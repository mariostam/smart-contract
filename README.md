# smart-contract
A smart contract for test transactions with ETH
A Solidity smart contract that simulates cryptocurrency transactions without using real ETH. Users can mint, transfer, burn, and check simulated balances, while the owner can manage limits and grant/reset balances. Includes basic security features like reentrancy protection and transaction limits.
No real ETH is used â€” all activity is purely simulated for testing or learning purposes.
